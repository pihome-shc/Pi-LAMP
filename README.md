#  Raspberry Pi LAMP Server. Apache, PHP 7.0 and MySQL/MariaDB on a Raspberry Pi

I have prepared Raspberry pi 8GB SD card image with the LAMP stack and including Apache, PHP 7.0 and MySQL/MariaDB and phpMyAdmin pre-installed and configured, you can download this image and burn it on SD card (minimum 8GB sd card required).

You need to expand the file system to the full size of the sd card. I did an update and upgrade to keep it all current to date 07-03-2018.

The Image is 1,760.78 MB in size and can be downloaded from http://www.pihome.eu/ all login credentials are on download page.
